# Puzy Toolbox
 a toolbox for a cloud gaming service

A project that had a long way to go, a toolbox for a cloud gaming service, fully developed in WPF C# ( and obviously not completed ) due to LEGAL problems in the team, so the name was changed to Edium and wanted to continue as a Launcher for games and applications, but obviously it didn't work out so the development was stopped.
